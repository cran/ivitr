Author: Bo Zhang
Maintainer: Bo Zhang <bozhan@wharton.upenn.edu>
Description: A method that estimates
    an IV-optimal individualized treatment rule. An individualized
    treatment rule is said to be IV-optimal if it minimizes the 
    maximum risk with respect to the putative IV and the set of
    IV identification assumptions. Please refer to 
    <arXiv:2002.02579> for more details on the methodology and 
    some theory underpinning the method. Function IV-PILE() uses
    functions in the package 'locClass'. Package 'locClass' can be
    accessed and installed from the 'R-Forge' repository via the following link: 
    <https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/locclass/>.
    Alternatively, one can install the package by entering the following in R:
    'install.packages("locClass", repos="<http://R-Forge.R-project.org>")'.
